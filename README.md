## üèõ Pantheon 
[![Build Pantheon](https://github.com/ericschmar/pantheon/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=release)](https://github.com/ericschmar/pantheon/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Introducing üèõ Pantheon! A simple, beautiful, cross-platform LDAP viewer. 

### Motivation

There are no good GUIs to interact with an LDAP out there. They are all decades old and likely only work on Windows. If you want a non-terminal based solution, you are really SOL. 

### Installing Pantheon

Head over to the Release page and download the correct build for your system. 

Mac users: I do not have any of the MacOS security stuff set up yet, so MacOS thinks this is a virus. In order to run it, simply run `xattr -c <path/to/application.app>` in your terminal.

### Technology Used

Wails, ReactJS, and Go. I took heavy inspiration from (zed.dev)[https://zed.dev/] for the UI, colors, and typeface.
