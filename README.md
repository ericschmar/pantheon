## 🏛 Pantheon

Introducing 🏛 Pantheon! A simple, cross-platform LDAP viewer. 

### Motivation

There are no good GUIs to interact with an LDAP out there. They are all decades old and likely only work on Windows. If you want a non-terminal based solution, you are really SOL. 

### Installing Pantheon

For now, download and install the latest `.dmg`. I plan to eventually support and build installers for Windows & Linux.

### Technology Used

Wails, ReactJS, and Go. I took heavy inspiration from (zed.dev)[https://zed.dev/] for the UI, colors, and typeface.
